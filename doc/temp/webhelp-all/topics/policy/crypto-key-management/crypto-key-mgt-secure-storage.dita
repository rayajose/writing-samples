                is important because it protects cryptographic keys from unauthorized access, which
                helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data. Without secure key
                storage, keys can be vulnerable to attacks that extract them from a device's storage
                or application. Secure storage is also important for the following reasons:</p>
