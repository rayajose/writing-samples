    <body>
        <p>Shop with Membership Rewards PointsÂ® is a comparison shopping portal, and not all
            merchants have the same offerings. Therefore, inclusion of promotional or
            merchant-specific text in the data is strictly prohibited, and any products containing
            such data will not be displayed on the site.</p>
        <note type="important">Any and all promotional, marketing, branding, or merchant specific
            content must be omitted from the feed data.</note>
