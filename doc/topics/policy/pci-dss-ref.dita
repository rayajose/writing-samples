                            <p> • Access to keys is restricted to the fewest number of custodians
                                necessary.</p>
                            <p> • Key-encrypting keys are at least as strong as the data-encrypting
                                keys they protect.</p>
                            <p> • Key-encrypting keys are stored separately from data-encrypting
                                keys.</p>
                            <p> • Keys are stored securely in the fewest possible locations and
