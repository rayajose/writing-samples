        <p><b>PCI-DSS-V4-3.7.2</b> Key-management policies and procedures are implemented to include
            secure distribution of cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data.</p>

        <section>
            <title>Access</title>
            <note> The Data Encryption Key (DEK) is used to encrypt the data. The Key Encryption Key
                (KEK) is used to encrypt the DEK. </note>
            <ul>
                <li>DEKs must be encrypted with KEKs.</li>
                <li>Key operations require membership in the ActiveDirectory (AD)
                        <b>key_custodian</b> security group. </li>
                <li>Key custodians are required to formally acknowledge that they understand and
                    accept their responsibilities.</li>
                <li>Key validation requires AD generated certificates.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Keys are not stored with the data they encrypt.  </li>
                <li>Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) are stored in the encrypting machines. </li>
                <li>Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) are stored in Hashicorp Vault. The vault is also
                    encrypted and locked down through AD account restrictions. </li>
                <li>Only one key data store per environment. </li>
