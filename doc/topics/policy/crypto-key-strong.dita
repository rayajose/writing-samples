        <p><b>PCI-DSS-V4-3.7.1</b> Key-management policies and procedures are implemented to include
            generation of strong cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data.</p>
        <note type="important">Cryptographic keys are classified as SECRET data and must be treated
            as such.</note>

            <p>Data is encrypted using the AES algorithm and 256-bit keys.</p>
            <p>Encryption is implemented using a two-tiered architecture. In order to mitigate the
                risk of any single key becoming lost, broken, or substituted, the system maintains a
                list of twenty-five, separate keys. </p>
            <p>Data is encrypted using a random key from the list and is subsequently stored in the
                database. </p>
            <p>Microsoft's <codeph>RandomNumberGenerator</codeph> is used to generate random key
                data.</p>
